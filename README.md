# watchman-clock

I made a digital clock out of an old Sony Watchman. This is the code to display the time as well as a rotating selection of trippy vintage computer animations as the background. It's simply a webpage that runs on startup.

I bought this chip (https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832796952913.html) and hooked it up to my Raspberry Pi. It simply broadcasts the video output as a UHF channel which the Watchman picks up once tuned to the proper channel.

## Featured Artists

- Lillian Schwartz & Ken Knowlton - Apotheosis (1973), Googolplex (1972), Olympiad (1971), Pixillation (1970), UFOs (1971)
- Robert Darroll - Feng Huang (1988)

I think each of these artist's art is quite incredible and goes perfectly with this project. I also added some other random "nostalgic" video artifacts like Space Invaders, VHS color screen, and footage from the old [Atari Video Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Video_Music) visualizer.
